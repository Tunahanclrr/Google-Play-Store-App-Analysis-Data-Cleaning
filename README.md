# 📱 Google Play Store App Analysis & Data Cleaning

In this project, I worked with a real-world dataset from the **Google Play Store**, focusing on data cleaning, preparation, and exploratory analysis.  
Unlike my earlier projects, I aimed to make this dataset completely ready for **machine learning and real-world insights** by applying extensive data preprocessing.

## 🔧 What I Did

- **Converted non-numeric to numeric:**  
  Transformed install counts, prices, and review numbers into numeric formats for accurate analysis.

- **Standardized dates and sizes:**  
  All app sizes were converted into KB, and release/update dates were standardized to `datetime` format.

- **Cleaned missing and erroneous data:**  
  Fixed inconsistencies in Android version, review count, and price columns.

- **Analyzed categories and ratings:**  
  Explored which app categories are most popular and how ratings vary across them.

## 🎯 Goal

The main goal of this project was to **prepare and clean the dataset** to make it fully analyzable and ready for **machine learning algorithms**.  
By cleaning and standardizing the data, this project lays the foundation for future predictive modeling and data-driven decision-making.
